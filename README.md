# Hora

**[[Homepage](https://horasearch.com/)]** **[[Document](https://horasearch.com/doc)]** **[[Examples](https://horasearch.com/doc/example.html)]**

***Hora Search Everywhere!***

Hora, a approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm library. We implement all code in `Rustü¶Ä` for reliability, high level abstraction and high speed comparable to `C++`.

Hora, **`„Åª„Çâ`** in Japanese, sound like `[h≈çl…ô]`, means `Wow`, `You see!` or `Look at that!`. The name is inspired by a famous Japanese song **`„ÄåÂ∞è„Åï„Å™ÊÅã„ÅÆ„ÅÜ„Åü„Äç`**.

# Examples

**`Rust` example**

```Rust
use hora::core::ann_index::ANNIndex;
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
use rand_distr::{Distribution, Normal};

pub fn demo() {
    let n = 1000;
    let dimension = 64;

    // make sample points
    let mut samples = Vec::with_capacity(n);
    let normal = Normal::new(0.0, 10.0).unwrap();
    for _i in 0..n {
        let mut sample = Vec::with_capacity(dimension);
        for _j in 0..dimension {
            sample.push(normal.sample(&mut rand::thread_rng()));
        }
        samples.push(sample);
    }

    let mut index = hora::index::hnsw_idx::HNSWIndex::<f32, usize>::new(
        dimension,
        &hora::index::hnsw_params::HNSWParams::<f32>::default(),
    ); // init index
    for (i, sample) in samples.iter().enumerate().take(n) {
        index.add(sample, i).unwrap(); // add point
    }
    index.build(hora::core::metrics::Metric::Euclidean).unwrap();

    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let target: usize = rng.gen_range(0..n);
    println!(
        "{:?} has neighbors: {:?}",
        target,
        index.search(&samples[target], 10) // search for k nearest neighbors
    ); // 523 has neighbors: [523, 762, 364, 268, 561, 231, 380, 817, 331, 246]
}
```

**`Python` exmaple**

```Python
import numpy as np
from hora import HNSWIndex

dimension = 50
n = 1000
index = HNSWIndex(dimension, "usize")
samples = np.float32(np.random.rand(n, dimension))
for i in range(0, len(samples)):
    index.add(np.float32(samples[i]), i)
index.build("euclidean")
target = np.random.randint(0, n)
print("{} has neighbors: {}".format(target, index.search(samples[target], 10))) # 631 has neighbors: [631, 656, 113, 457, 584, 179, 586, 979, 619, 976]

```

# Roadmap

- [ ] Full Coverage Test
- [ ] implement [EFANNA](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07228) algo to achieve faster KNN graph building
- [ ] Swift Support and also IOS/Mac OS deployment example
- [ ] Support `R` 
- [ ] support `mmap`

# Related Projects and Comparison

* [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann): 
  * **`Hora`'s implementation is strongly inspired by these lib.**
  * `Faiss` focus more on the GPu scenerio, and `Hora` is lighter than Faiss, such as **no heavy dependency**.
  * `Hora` expects to support more language, and everything related to performance shall be implemented by Rustü¶Ä.
  * `Annoy` only support `LSH(Random Projection)` algorithm.
  * `ScaNN` and `Faiss` are less user-friendly, such as lack of document.
  * Hora is **ALL IN RUST** ü¶Ä.

* [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), [Vald](https://github.com/vdaas/vald), [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina)
  * `Milvus` and `Vald` also support multiple languages, but serve as a service instead of a lib
  * `Milvus` is built upon some libs such as `Faiss`, while `Hora` is an algorithm lib with all the algo implemented by itself
